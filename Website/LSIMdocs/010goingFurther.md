Now that you have mastered the basics you should feel confident in making any scene that your heart desires (within the capabilities of the engine).
In this section we will talk about:
* Config files (how to use them and how they work)
* How the logging system works
* how fileIO works
This will give you a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes and how you can modify the engine to meet your needs.
